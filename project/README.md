## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd streamlink-monorepo
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start local services** (Redis and PostgreSQL):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you don't have Docker installed or prefer not to use Redis:
   - The app will continue to work without Redis, but with limited queue processing functionality
   - Background jobs and scheduled tasks will be disabled
   - You can skip this step for basic development, but Redis is recommended for full functionality

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```
   
   **Redis Configuration** (optional but recommended):
   - `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL (default: `redis://localhost:6379`)
   - `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 20)
   - `REDIS_ENABLE_OFFLINE_QUEUE`: Keep jobs queued when offline (default: true)
   - `REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in ms (default: 10000)
   
   If Redis is unavailable, the services will log a warning and continue with limited functionality.

4. **Run database migrations and seed**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed
   ```

5. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will start:
- API server on http://localhost:3001
- Worker service on http://localhost:3002
- Mobile app via Expo CLI

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages and services
- `pnpm dev` - Start all services in development mode
- `pnpm test` - Run tests across all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all code
- `pnpm db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `pnpm db:seed` - Seed database with demo data
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio
- `pnpm db:reset` - Reset database (destructive)

## � Background Jobs

StreamLink offers **two options** for handling background jobs:

### Option 1: Worker Service (Traditional)
- Custom NestJS microservice with BullMQ/Redis
- Full control over business logic
- Best for complex computations

### Option 2: n8n Workflow Automation ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **80-90% faster development**
- **Visual workflow designer** - no code needed
- **Built-in integrations** for 350+ services
- **Zero-downtime updates**
- **85% cost reduction** vs custom worker

See **[N8N_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./N8N_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** for detailed setup instructions.

See **[ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md](./ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md)** for full comparison and ROI analysis.

### What the Background System Does:
- **Every 10 minutes**: Check live status across platforms
- **Hourly**: Sync latest content and stats
- **Daily**: Create stats snapshots for analytics
- **On-demand**: Process platform and payment webhooks
- **Every 6 hours**: Refresh OAuth tokens
- **Weekly**: Send analytics email reports

## �🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Key entities include:

- **User**: Core user entity with role-based access (VIEWER/STREAMER/BOTH)
- **LinkedPlatformAccount**: Connected social media accounts
- **StreamerProfile/ViewerProfile**: Role-specific profile data
- **ContentItem**: Aggregated content from platforms
- **StatsSnapshot**: Daily analytics snapshots
- **Reward/Redemption**: Points-based reward system
- **Poll/MiniGame**: Interactive engagement features
- **Product/Order**: Marketplace functionality

## 🔧 API Documentation

The API is fully documented with OpenAPI/Swagger. Once the API server is running, visit:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:3001/api/docs

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/v1/streamers/{id}/profile` - Public streamer profile
- `GET /api/v1/viewers/following` - User's followed streamers
- `POST /api/v1/interactions/polls` - Create poll
- `GET /api/v1/marketplace/products/{streamerId}` - Streamer products

## 📱 Mobile App

The mobile app is built with React Native and Expo, featuring:

- **Dark theme** with cyan/aqua accent colors
- **Tab navigation** with Home, Discover, Live, Rewards, and Profile screens
- **Authentication flow** with onboarding, login, and registration
- **Real-time interactions** for polls and mini-games
- **Points and rewards system** with redemption tracking
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile devices

### Key Screens

1. **Home**: Dashboard showing live streamers and following list
2. **Discover**: Browse and follow new streamers
3. **Live**: Real-time interactions, polls, and mini-games
4. **Rewards**: Points balance and redemption history
5. **Profile**: User settings and account management

## 🎨 Iconography

StreamLink leans into a playful, pixel-forward brand language. The shared `Icon` component accepts a `variant` prop with three modes:

- `auto` *(default)* — renders the Phosphor vector icon set, falling back to our curated pixelarticons glyphs if a vector name is unavailable.
- `vector` — forces the Phosphor icon, emitting a warning when the glyph is missing instead of applying a fallback.
- `pixel` — always renders the pixel SVG for a perfectly blocky aesthetic.

For edge cases you can import `PixelIcon` directly from `project/src/ui`, which exposes the same icon names and sizing tokens as the shared UI package. Both components respect accessible labelling via the `label` prop; omit it for decorative usage so assistive tech stays quiet.

## 🔄 Background Jobs

The worker service handles scheduled tasks:

- **Every 10 minutes**: Check live status across platforms
- **Hourly**: Sync latest content and stats
- **Daily**: Create stats snapshots for analytics
- **Webhooks**: Process platform and payment webhooks

## 🔐 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** with refresh token rotation
- **Encrypted platform tokens** at rest
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **RBAC guards** for role-based access control
- **GDPR compliance** with data export/deletion

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit tests** for core business logic
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **E2E tests** for critical user flows
- **Mobile tests** with React Native Testing Library

Run tests with:
```bash
pnpm test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is containerized and ready for deployment:

- **Docker images** for API and worker services
- **Kubernetes manifests** in `/k8s` directory
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment-specific** configuration

## 📊 Demo Data

The seed script creates demo data including:
- 1 demo streamer account
- 50 demo viewer accounts
- Sample content items and stats
- Rewards and redemptions
- 14 days of analytics snapshots

Login with demo accounts:
- **Streamer**: `streamer@example.com` / `password123`
- **Viewer**: `viewer1@example.com` / `password123`

## ⚠️ Known Web Console Notes

- The Expo web build currently suppresses a React Native Web warning about `pointerEvents` props by using `LogBox.ignoreLogs`. This is a temporary measure until upstream packages migrate to the new `style.pointerEvents` API.
- When the auth modal stack animates on the web, the browser may report `aria-hidden` focus warnings. These stem from React Navigation's focus management on modal overlays and do not block interaction. Monitor future library releases for a permanent fix.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Redis Connection Errors

If you see errors like `MaxRetriesPerRequestError: Reached the max retries per request limit`:

1. **Check if Redis is running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep redis
   ```

2. **Start Redis via Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d redis
   ```

3. **Verify Redis connection**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it streamlink-redis redis-cli ping
   ```
   Should return `PONG`

4. **Alternative: Run without Redis**:
   - The app is designed to gracefully handle Redis unavailability
   - Services will continue with limited queue processing
   - Check logs for "Redis connection failed. Service will continue with limited functionality."

### App Stops After a While

If services stop unexpectedly:
- Check Redis is running and accessible
- Review environment variables in `.env`
- Increase `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` if experiencing connection issues
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

### Database Connection Issues

If you see Prisma connection errors:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running via Docker Compose
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your setup
- Run migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
